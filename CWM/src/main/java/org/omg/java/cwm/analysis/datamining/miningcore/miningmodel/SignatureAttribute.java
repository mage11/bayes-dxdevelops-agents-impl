/**
 * CWM Class
 * 
 * A SignatureAttribute object describes the input expected to a model. This is
 * automatically produced as part of the model. It indicates not only the basic Attribute
 * properties, but also how outliers and missing values were handled for model build. This
 * is potentially duplicate information from the MiningFunctionSettings, but must be
 * provided since MiningFunctionSettings are optional.
 * If an attribute was normalized or discretized automatically by the Data Mining System,
 * the specific details are provided in the SignatureAttribute object. The user is not
 * expected to use this information to preprocess the data in any way. The Data Mining
 * System uses this information to automatically preprocess data, if required.
