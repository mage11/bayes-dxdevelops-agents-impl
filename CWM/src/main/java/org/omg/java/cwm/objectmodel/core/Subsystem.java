/**
 * A subsystem is a grouping of model elements that represents a behavioral unit
 * in a physical system. A subsystem offers interfaces and has operations.
 * In the metamodel, Subsystem is a subclass of both Package and Classifier. As
 * such it may have a set of Features.
 * The purpose of the subsystem construct is to provide a grouping mechanism for
 * specifying a behavioral unit of a physical system. Apart from defining a
 * namespace for its contents, a subsystem serves as a specification unit for the
 * behavior of its contained model elements.
 * The contents of a subsystem is defined in the same way as for a package, thus it
 * consists of owned elements and imported elements, with unique names within the
 * subsystem.
