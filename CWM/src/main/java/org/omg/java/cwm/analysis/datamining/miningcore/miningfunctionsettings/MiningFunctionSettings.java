 * A MiningFunctionSettings object captures the high level specification input for

 * to specify the type of the desired result without having to specify a particular
 * algorithm.
 * Although mining function settings allow for the specification of algorithm, if this is
 * omitted, the underlying data mining system is responsible for selecting the algorithm
 * based on basic user-provided parameters.
 *  
 * Subclasses throw exceptions if invalid algorithm-function pairs are supplied.
